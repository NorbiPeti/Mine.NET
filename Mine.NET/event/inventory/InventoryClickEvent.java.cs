     * This event is called when a player clicks a slot in an inventory.
     * <p>
     * Because InventoryClickEvent occurs within a modification of the Inventory,
     * not all Inventory related methods are safe to use.
     * <p>
     * The following should never be invoked by an EventHandler for
     * InventoryClickEvent using the HumanEntity or InventoryView associated with
     * this event:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link HumanEntity#closeInventory()}
     * <li>{@link HumanEntity#openInventory(Inventory)}
     * <li>{@link HumanEntity#openWorkbench(Location, bool)}
     * <li>{@link HumanEntity#openEnchanting(Location, bool)}
     * <li>{@link InventoryView#close()}
     * </ul>
     * To invoke one of these methods, schedule a task using 
     * {@link BukkitScheduler#runTask(Plugin, Action)}, which will run the task
     * on the next tick. Also be aware that this is not an exhaustive list, and
     * other methods could potentially create issues as well.
     * <p>
     * Assuming the EntityHuman associated with this event is an instance of a
     * Player, manipulating the MaxStackSize or contents of an Inventory will
     * require an Invocation of {@link Player#updateInventory()}.
     * <p>
     * Modifications to slots that are modified by the results of this
     * InventoryClickEvent can be overwritten. To change these slots, this event
     * should be cancelled and all desired changes to the inventory applied.
     * Alternatively, scheduling a task using {@link BukkitScheduler#runTask(
     * Plugin, Action)}, which would execute the task on the next tick, would
     * work as well.
